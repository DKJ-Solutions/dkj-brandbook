### PLAN

The settings panel closed on a click inside it, off its controls (#68): the focus-out close from the #66 review read a null `relatedTarget` (focus moving to `body` on a click on a non-focusable spot) as focus leaving the panel.

### CREATE

- [x] `src/showcase/Showcase.tsx`: the focus-out close acts only when focus moves to an element outside the panel; clicks stay with the document pointerdown handler, which already tells inside from outside

### TEST

- [x] `scripts/lint/lint-web.ps1` green (eslint, var check, tsc, build)
- [ ] An owner has clicked inside the open panel (title, labels, padding) and it stays open; a click outside still closes it

#### What does the change on this branch deploy to main?
